# Apollo-Backend

## TODO
Probably create a GitHub organisation `ApolloFiles` and have the following repos:

* Apollo (the Backend, so this one)
* Apollo-Frontend (contains the frontend and is included as dependency in the backend)
* Module-* (The official modules available in Apollo [some installed by default or not listed as module to the admin])
  * Module ideas:
    * Thumbnails
    * ClamAV (+ VirusTotal)
    * file converter (e.g. png to jpeg or word to pdf)
    * file preview (syntax highlighting?)
    * Image editor
    * file editor
    * Video editor
    * ffmpeg (+ Batch mode with stream-selection-filter)
    * File search
    * File sharing
    * FTP(S), SSH, WebDAV, ...
    * Some kind of Watch-Party where you can share a link with friends and family to view images/videos together
